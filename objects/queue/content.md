# Lab: Queue

[Follow this link](https://lab.cs50.io/minprog/objects/master/queue/lab) to get started.

After finishing, you should download your `queue.py` from the lab and submit it below.

**When storing `queue.py` make sure it is not in the same folder as `.ipynb` files. This can cause your notebook server to crash!** The easiest way to prevent this is to put it in it's own folder.
